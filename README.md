## To-Do Application
This is a project that I had during my first semester of Computer Science. 
It is a user-friendly command line interface for a To-Do List.

##### When you start the application from the command line, you will have options to
* Add to the list
* Show the list
* Remove something from the list
* Clear the list
* Quit the application.

I am using the module readline to store items that will then persist in memory, even after the application is quit. 

## Technology
This project is create with:
* Python Version: 3.8.
